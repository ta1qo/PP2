Does it smell like a school gymnasium in here?
It's funny how they're all the same
It's funny how you always remember
And we've both done it all a hundred times before
It's funny how I still forgot
It would be a hundred times easier
If we were young again
But as it is and it is
We're just two slow dancers, last ones out
We're two slow dancers, last ones out
â™ª
And the ground has been slowly pulling us back down
You see it on both our skin
We get a few years, and then it wants us back
It would be a hundred times easier
If we were young again
But as it is, and it is
To think that we could stay the same
To think that we could stay the same
To think that we could stay the same
But we're two slow dancers, last ones out
We're two slow dancers, last ones out
Two slow dancers, last ones out
